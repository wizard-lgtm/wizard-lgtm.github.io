<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<p>I&#39;m at the library again, an a diffrent one. This place is much smaller and much worse than yesterday. There&#39;s a fan fucks my mind, fortunately i have my heaphones so i don&#39;t need to hear it at all the time. </p>
<p>I checked the computers again, which there was six, every one of them was occupied, so i had to use my rusty 2000$ worth of fucking macbook which it&#39;s useless unless watching videos/movies.</p>
<p>I got a gum from the kid sitting my on my left. I didn&#39;t say thanks but i made a thumbsup emoji to him. Well at least i said something.</p>
<p>Everybody is working for college here, i don&#39;t know they&#39;re enjoying of that, or i don&#39;t even know they should do that, but they&#39;re just doing. </p>
<p>Soo, i guess i had to use that computer, i must do something with it. I wanna try that new brand Helix text editor. I&#39;m dropping the <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">link</a> over here, it&#39;s kinda vim, but it&#39;s not. Idk</p>
<p>Soo, you might ask me &quot;WHY YOU&#39;RE USING THE PUBLIC COMPUTERS INSTEAD OF YOUR FUCKING MACBOOK PRO YOU STUPID IDIOT&quot; and i would say, &quot;yes ma&#39;am ur right but listen me first&quot;. So if i&#39;m gonna use enough of that public computers enough, i&#39;ll miss my macbook pro. At least i&#39;m trying to do that and i hope it&#39;s going to be work.</p>
