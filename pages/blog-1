for some reason i wanna write that page in a public library computer, the weather was could outside so i decided to enter library
which that is something i wouldn't do over a couple of years. 
That is actually the first thing i did for myself since the new year. I don't know what's the reason but in those days i'm doing nothing at home.
But when i see some oldschool public computer i suddenly wanting to do something, maybe because of everyone working in here.
I'm doing nothing at home, i have a good quality windows computer and a macbook pro that i've paid over 2000 dollars but doing nothing beside watching youtube videos.
I just realized i had more when i had less.
What happened to me then?
What happened?
I must do somethings, i was about to write some chat app with ziglang but i stopped.
i wanted to do some gui sdl2 stuff, but i stopped.
What is happening?
